Yes, just remember your credentials. You can start, leave and rejoin anytime in the 72 hours. The event is designed to be much shorter than 72 hours. The longer duration has been kept to allow everyone to participate at whatever time works for them.

Q.2 [Answer] 150

Q.3 [Answer] damnyou

Q.4 [Answer] adp

#### Stage 2:
Q.1 [Answer] 117.220.175.231 (Ping the web host www.bits-pilani.ac.in in your terminal. The IP address you get there is the answer.)

Q.2 [Answer] 89 (This is a pental number system where D=4,E=3,N=2. Hence END=3*25+2*5+4*1=89)

Q.3 [Answer] :') (This is a one-to-one mapping where each digit/symbol is mapped to the corresponding digit in the RHS. After that the combination of digits is used and converted to the characters according to suitable ASCII codes.)

#### Stage 3:
Q.1 and Q.2: [Answer] (You need to inspect element any of the options and change their HTML tag and make the value of attribute "value" to "2" and "4" respectively for each question.)

#### Stage 4:
Q.1 [Answer] cglite (It is actually an SVG image which appears to be the white background. Download the image, and open it in a text editor. Apart from the first instance of "white", change all instances to "black" and then open the image in browser/image viewer. It has transformed to a QR code! Scan it!)

#### Stage 5:
Q.1 [Answer] carnicobar (obtain all the values of the binary number I3I2I1I0, I3 being the Most Significant bit, for which Z evaluates to true. These values are hexadecimal A, B and C. Out of all combinations, CAB is the code for the airport name 'Carnicobar'.)

#### Stage 6:
Q.1 [Answer] whentheredstarts (As in stage 4, download the image and open with text editor, preferably notepad. Scroll down to the end. You'll find the line written as "Try AES", copy the part after that. Go to an online AES decoder and paste it there. The secret key is "noob". )
